# RL-Proposed-Solution-for-Fighting-Skin-Diseases-Eczema
We propose a simulation project to aid in the fight against skin diseases using Reinforcement Learning(RL) approach by considering the infected skin area as an environment and the germs, bacteria, virus as the target in which the agent aims to defeat.
