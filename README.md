# RL-Proposed-Solution-for-Fighting-Skin-Diseases-Eczema
We propose a simulation project to aid in the fight against skin diseases using Reinforcement Learning(RL) approach by considering the infected skin area as an environment and the germs, bacteria, virus as the target in which the agent aims to defeat. 

The main goal of this project is to proposed a solution for fighting skin diseases using Reinforcement Learning, and our focus is on Eczema, which happens to be one of the commonest skin diseases in Africa. We believe this is feasible and when completed, would be a new face for understanding the dynamics for treating other skin cancerous ailments.
